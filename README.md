Reflection:

I still feel a little bit confused on how to work with the view engine. I loved the process of orgainizing my code the way you showed in the lecture, but I did encounter issues when I didn't import and export correctly. With more time I would continue to work on the user interaction piece and get my data to display on the rendered view. I would also add more routes for my other data collections, specifically ones that use req.query.
